            Food is an essential part of keeping yourself in shape. As a student you have many obstacles to creating eating habits that will help you stay fit. But maybe my suggestions can inspire you in some way.

            <p><b>Cooking can be fun</b><br>
                It’s not only that you have to stick to a budget, but also you should adapt your diet to your cooking skills. Although it might be hard-it is not impossible. Meal preparation is not only essential if you want to keep yourself fit, but also a lot of fun. You need only one hour to prepare your food for the next 3/4 days-if you arrange it wisely. :)

                    There is one easy way to spend 20 minutes every Sunday to look at the upcoming sales and plan your shopping- it’s very useful when you have a weekly grocery list at the supermarket and it is even proved that it prevent you from buying unnecessary items when sticking to it, of course.

            <p><b>Preparation</b>
                Having your meals ready for the upcoming days will excite you for the next dish. It also prevents you from buying junk food, which does not give you the essential nutrients for good health.</p>

        <div class="internet">
            <b>Browse the Internet</b><br>
            Another advice of mine is to mark down some healthy recipes that you really like and enjoy. There are many websites that you can visit to find ideas for dishes. It is also important to experiment with your food. Make it tasty. Be brave with adding herbs.

            <b>WATER</b>
            Water is also an important part of every healthy lifestyle. If you are not used to drinking a lot of water I might help you with some tricks:<br>
            -always carry a bottle of water with you (this really changes the game)<br>
            -try adding some lemon <br>
            -make a habit of having one glass of water immediately after waking up<br>
            -make gel water (just add some chia seeds and let it stay for a bit)<br>
            -coconut water is very hydrating as well <br>
